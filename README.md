A piece of advice for potential students: Consider carefully before enrolling in this course, especially if you are not a proficient coder or lack substantial knowledge of deep learning concepts. CS7643 is a highly demanding course, and the assignments require a significant time investment.

The course includes challenging quizzes, and understanding the lectures may be difficult. Extensive reading of papers and online resources is often necessary to grasp the material effectively. It's important to note that the course lectures may not directly align with the assignment requirements, necessitating additional self-study and research to succeed.

Exercise caution and ensure that you are well-prepared for the intensive workload of this course. Additionally, the group project is also challenging, so be prepared for a comprehensive learning experience.
